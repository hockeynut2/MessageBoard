# MessageBoard

This is a Marvel-themed message board.

From the create user page, you choose a username and password and you will be directed to the login page. Passwords are stored in the database as BCrypt password objects.

Once you log in, you will be redirected to the homepage where you can see all the threads.

You will be greeted by your username in the top right hand corner of the window.

You can create threads using the form beneath the table of threads.

Clicking on a thread's name redirects you to a page showing all the posts under the thread.

You will notice that you can only remove posts that the user currently signed in created.

Searching a user's name in the search box in the navbar will redirect you to the user if he/she exists. Otherwise you will be sent to the page with all users.

Clicking the tiny Marvel logo in the top left will return you to the threads homepage.
